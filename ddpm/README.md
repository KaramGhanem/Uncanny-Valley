# Diffusion-Models

Implementation was inspired by code in https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch.
We conducted our study and built our code based on the structure outlined in the github above.


We have created seperate script files for Ho et al's DDPM for different datasets.
We have also created seperate script files for Misguided diffusion and Guided Diffusion.

Most of the scripts have been created previously and are inspirewd by various studies.
Our main contribution code-wise, happens to be Misguided Diffusion where classifier guidance
is conducted with an untrained classifier. 

Otherwise all variations of Diffusion Models that we have experimented on have various 
open-source implementations.
